# Optimize Exercise

## Build Muscle


### Maximize Muscle Growth (Hypertrophy)

- Take 1-2 days before re working same muscle group. Overtraining leaves no room for muscles to heal & grow.
- Rep range is flexible for hypertrophy. 5-30 reps is fine. Intensity is more important.
- Maximize intensity. Indensity = Speed x strength

### Maximize Muscle Strength

- For strength, you should be at 80-90% of 1 rep max. Find 1 rep max based on your current 10 rep max using [tables online.](https://strengthlevel.com/one-rep-max-calculator)

### Maximize Muscle Endurance or Power

- For Endurance or Power, you could train the same muscles 6 days a week. E.g. runners can run every day.

- Eat whole foods
- Hydrate
- Baking soda as supplement
- Creatine best supplement
- Heat after workout is good
- Cold shower in morning is good, right after a workout is bad
- Consider electrolyte beverages to improve hydration
- Breathe and only breathe for 5 minutes after hard workout or climbing. Don't go straight to social media. Good for neurons and improving technique (applies to musical instruments too)
- Also good advice is to hit peak heart rate 1x per week minimum. 220 - age = max. 196 bpm for me. Listen to fast music like drum and bass (170-180 bpm) to make running easier. I try to do a "maximum effort" 3km run, where my legs are on fire and I'm gasping for air by the time I get home.

## Reduce time spent working out

- Superset to reduce workout time. E.g. do a push exercise while resting from a pull exercise.
- Or stretch between sets

## Weekly Exercise Goals

- 150-180 mins of cardio per week
- 3x intense resistance training sessions
- 3x stretching (superset stretching in between sets)

## Burn fat

- Fidgeting burns calories
- Shivering from cold makes fat cells produce more heat. Increases base rate of calorie burn.
- Fasting before long exercise will burn fat after 90 mins of exercise
- Optimal: 20-60 mins HIGH intensity workout. Squat, deadlift, etc. Superset. Then any moderate intensity after that should start burning fat instead of sugars. Do this fasted
- Caffeine before exercise is helpful. Mate tea is even better. Boosts glp1 guayusa same as mate . Tastes better?
- Less carbs> less insulin > burn fat not sugar. Eat carbs later in the day.
- Acetyl L Carnatine increases oxidation.

## Get Flexible

- 30 seconds static stretching is optimal
- 3x30s per muscle each exercise
