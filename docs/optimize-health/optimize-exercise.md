# Optimize Exercise

## Build Muscle

- Maximisze hypertrophy (muscle growth): take 1-2 rest days before re working same muscle group
- Rep range is flexible for hypertrophy. 5-30 reps.
- Intensity drives hypertrophy. Speed x strength
- For strength, should be at 80-90% of 1 rep max. Find 1 rep max using tables online.

- Hit peak heart rate 1x per week minimum. 220 - age = max. 196 bpm for me. Listen to DnB (170-180 bpm) I should be faster.
- Endurance or power training? Can't get enough of it.
- Eat whole foods
- Hydrate
- Baking soda as supplement
- Creatine best supplement
- Heat after workout is good
- Cold shower in morning is good
- Consider electrolyte beverages
- Breathe and only breathe for 5 minutes after hard workout or climbing. Don't go straight to social media. Good for neurons and improving technique

## Reduce time spent working out

- Superset to reduce workout time. E.g. do a push exercise while resting from a pull exercise.
- Or stretch between sets

## Weekly Exercise Goals

- 150-180 mins of cardio per week
- 3x intense resistance training sessions
- 3x stretching (superset stretching in between sets)

## Burn fat

- Fidgeting burns calories
- Shivering from cold makes fat cells produce more heat. Increases base rate of calorie burn.
- Fasting before long exercise will burn fat after 90 mins of exercise
- Optimal: 20-60 mins HIGH intensity workout. Squat, deadlift, etc. Superset. Then any moderate intensity after that should start burning fat instead of sugars. Do this fasted
- Caffeine before exercise is helpful. Mate tea is even better. Boosts glp1 guayusa same as mate . Tastes better?
- Less carbs> less insulin > burn fat not sugar. Eat carbs later in the day.
- Acetyl L Carnatine increases oxidation.

## Get Flexible

- 30 seconds static stretching is optimal
- 3x30s per muscle each exercise
