# Optimize Focus

## Cold Exposure

1-5 minutes of uncomfortable (but safe) cold water exposure will spike adrenaline (epinepherine). 

Acute stress improves cognitive performance. At least 1 hour or more of focus boost.

## 40 Hz Binaural Beats

Two sine waves, one slightly different frequency to the other. For some reason, the brain likes this.

## Supplements

Caffeine (100-400 mg / day). Avoid after 2PM since it disrupts sleep.

EPA Omega 3 (1-3g / day)

Creatine (2.5-5g / day)

## Food

Fasted state = more focus

"Fed" state = more focus

Eating a big meal, however, will decrease focus. Digestion takes lots of energy. 

## Meditation 

13 minutes. Nasal breathing. "Place your concentration 1 inch behind your forehead (into your head). You'll be training your brain to learn how to get into a state of focus. It's OK to lose focus, that's the whole point, it gives you another chance to get back into the state of focus. 

Meditation provides benefits to sleep and memory as well as focus. 

Meditation for focus can disturb sleep since it requires mental energy. Try to avoid focus meditation 4 hours before sleep.

I meditate as soon as I wake up in the morning.
