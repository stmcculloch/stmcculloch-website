# Optimize Sleep

## Light

Light signals to the body what time of day it is. Humans didn't evolve with a watch in their pocket. 
Andrew Huberman cannot stress this enough. Viewing sunlight every day is very important for mental and physical health.

### Morning Light Viewing
- Intentionally view sunlight within 30 minutes of waking up. Don't look directly at the sun, but do look at the sky close to the sun. Don't use sunglasses.
- Clear skies? 5 minutes of bright sunlight is enough.
- Cloudy? 10-20 mins required. Walk around the block
- Too early? Use very bright artificial light. Try to get at least 5000 lux

### Afternoon Light Viewing
- View low solar angle light in the afternoon.

### Evening Light Viewing
- Avoid bright lights after 10 PM. Even brief (1 second) viewing of intense light (phone screen, computer monitor) can have detrimental effects on sleep.\

### Skipping A Day

If you skip a day of light viewing, that's fine. Just don't skip 2 days in a row.

## Temperature

- Room temperature should be cool but not cold
- Body requires a few degrees drop in body temperature in order to fall asleep
- Have a warm shower before bed. Makes your body stop producing it's own heat, and you'll be cooler once you go to bed. 
- Avoid being very cold before going to bed. Body will warm up and make it harder to sleep.

## Environment

- Avoid loud intermittent noises (traffic, crying children, loud parties)
- Avoid lights. A very dark bedroom is ideal.
- If possible, sleep next to a window without blinds, so the sun can naturally wake you up.
- Otherwise, get smart lights on a timer, to turn on at a specific time every morning.

## Food

- Avoid large meals right before sleeping. Have a large dinner 4 hours before sleep, maybe a small snack before bed.
- Carbs make you sleepy. Avoid carbs for breakfast and lunch. Save them for dinner. Fruit, veggies, and protein are good choices for breakfast and lunch.\\

## Exercise

- Avoid exercising right before going to bed. Causes a spike in adrenaline which keeps you awake.
- Try to keep it 4 hours before sleeping. 
- Bedtime is 11 PM? Finish your workout by 7 PM.

## Drugs

- Avoid caffeine in late afternoon. Hard cut-off at 4 PM. Ideally 2 PM.
- Avoid drinking alcohol before going to bed. Makes it easier to fall asleep, but disturbs sleep during the night.
- Avoid smoking weed before going to bed. Makes it easier to fall asleep, but disturbs sleep during the night.
