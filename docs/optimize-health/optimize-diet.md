## Intermittent fasting

- Can also [improve muscle maintenance](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19945408/)
- Easiest way to perform intermittent fasting is only eat during an 8 hour window. 
- First meal at noon. Last meal at 8 PM.
- This has the benefit of reducing snacking since you'll naturally want bigger meals.
