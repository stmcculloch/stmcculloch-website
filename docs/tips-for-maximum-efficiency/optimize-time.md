title: 'Optimize Time'
---

The amount of time in each week is limited. Don't waste it.

I created a spreadsheet to identify sources of wasted time: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1f0x7OE_18n90BwnSZHhIze_-CeKupGsV47NCPUsHylM/edit?usp=sharing

It sorts them and color-codes items that will have the most bang-for-buck. 

When I filled it in for myself, it turns out sleeping is the most important thing to optimize. I waste 30 minutes in bed each day, 15 waking up, and 15 before going to sleep. Also, I expect that my sleep quality can be improved so that I don't need so have as much sleep.

## Return on Time, not Investment

Spend time doing things that provide the most value. Learning is a good place to start.
