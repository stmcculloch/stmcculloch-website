title: 'Optimize Time'
---

The amount of time in each week is limited. Don't waste it.

I created a spreadsheet to identify sources of wasted time: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1f0x7OE_18n90BwnSZHhIze_-CeKupGsV47NCPUsHylM/edit?usp=sharing

It sorts them and color-codes items that will have the most bang-for-buck. 

When I filled it in for myself, it turns out sleeping is the most important thing to optimize. I waste 30 minutes in bed each day, 15 waking up, and 15 before going to sleep. Also, I expect that my sleep quality can be improved so that I don't need so have as much sleep.

## Create Free Time by Removing Activities

It seems to be much easier to add things to your life than to remove things from your life. Getting good at removing things from your life will allow you to have more free time which you can use for more important things. Here is a list of activities I've cut from my life:

- Watching movies
- Watching TV shows
- Video games
- Browsing Reddit

You might also have to make some tough decisions. For me that was chess. At one point, I was spending over 1 hour every day playing chess, watching chess videos, thinking about chess, even studying chess. I was also pretty good at chess, and my natural instinct was to become even better. But taking a step back, I realized that I don't need to be better at chess. Chess doesn't matter, it's just a game. So I no longer play chess, as it just wastes time, and in most cases it just stresses me out.

The best way to remove activities is to make them inconvenient and unsatisfying. I'm using [BlockSite](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/blocksite-block-websites/eiimnmioipafcokbfikbljfdeojpcgbh) to prevent myself from playing chess. Speaking of making things unsatisfying...

## Make Your Phone Boring

I realized I wanted to stop wasting time on my phone, so I started by deleting apps that I would waste time on. 

Reddit by far was the biggest time-suck, so I deleted it. Netflix as well. After taking a long break, I realize I don't miss them at all.

I removed all games from my phone, except for [Simon Tatham's Puzzle Collection](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/puzzles/). Maybe I'll remove that one too someday, but I usually only play it on the bus.

Youtube is the next one on the chopping block, but I find it too useful to delete completely. It's also educational. This one I will try to keep in moderation.

## Social Media Cleanse

You probably spend (dare I say waste) 2 hours or more per day on social media. I recommend avoiding any algorithm-based apps that promote scrolling (Instagram, Reddit, TikTok Twitter, Youtube etc.). The algorithm is optimized to keep you watching. It is not optimized to provide you meaningful benefits.

I find it much more fulfilling to actively search for the thing you want to learn about. Podcasts and Audiobooks are a great replacement for Youtube and Netflix. 

For any social media apps that survive the purge, I recommend cleansing them. Unsubscribe from old or irrelevant Youtube channels, unsubscribe from dumb and silly subreddits, delete Facebook friends you don't know. Spend at least 1 full hour cleansing each social media app. It's a drop in the bucket compared to how much time you'll waste sifting through irrelevent content. While you're at it, go through your email and unsubscribe from all the newsletters you didn't sign up for.
