# Fuel-Efficient Driving Techniques

1. **Accelerate gently.** Take 5 seconds to go from 0 to 20 km/h
2. **Maintain a steady speed.** Varying your speed up and down between 75 and 85 km per hour every 18 seconds can increase your fuel use by 20%.
    - Learn to use cruise control while highway driving.
    - For optimal results, allow speed to drop when going uphill, and regain momentum going downhill. Use gravity
3. **Brake early when approaching a red light**, so that you don't have to come to a complete stop.
4. **Use a big buffer between your car and the car in front**. Therefore, if you need to slow down, you can just ease off the gas instead of pumping the brakes. 
5. **Drag forces scale with velocity-squared.** 
    - For example, at 120 km per hour, a vehicle uses about 20% more fuel than at 100 km per hour. On a 25-km trip, this spike in speed – and fuel consumption – would cut just two minutes from your travel time.
6. **Avoid idling.** 30 minutes of idling = 1L of fuel
7. **Keep tires inflated to the correct pressure.** Under-filled tires increase rolling resistance. Up to 5% increase in fuel costs for being 8psi below rated pressure.
8. **Avoid carrying unnecessary weight.** Keep the trunk empty. Extra 1% more consumption for ever 25kg of items in the car.
9. **Air conditioning can increase fuel use by up to 20%.** Open windows when city driving. AC on the highway.
10. **Drive less.** When you walk or bike, you get exercise, and it is free!
