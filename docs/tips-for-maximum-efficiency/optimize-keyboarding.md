## Hotkeys I Use Every Day (Windows)

### Re-open closed tab on Chrome

Hotkey: Ctrl + Shift + T

If you closed the wrong tab, use this to reopen it.

Did you accidently close your entire browser? Use this to restore all your tabs.

### Best Way to Take Screenshots

Hotkey: Windows + Shift + S

Drag a box around the place you want to screenshot. It's saved to your clipboard, so you can just paste it anywhere.

### Manage Windows

Hotkey: Alt + Tab (Alt + Shift + Tab to reverse direction)

Use this to quickly swap to a different application without moving your mouse.

### Manage Tabs

Hotkey: Ctrl + Tab (Ctrl + Shift + Tab to reverse direction)

Use this to quickly swap to a different Chrome browser tab without moving your mouse.

### Close Window

Hotkey: Ctrl + W

Closes the current window. While using Chrome, it closes the current tab.

## Put the Computer To Sleep

Hotkey combo: (Windows + X), let go, (U), let go, (S).

Puts the (Windows) computer to sleep. Very helpful for when you want to turn the computer off, but don't want to turn the monitor on, ruining your night vision.

## Misc Tips and Tricks

### Right Side Enter Key

When you have one hand on the mouse and one hand on the keyboard, you can use your right-hand thumb to hit the enter key. Very useful when navigating windows. You can usually hit enter instead of fumbling around with your mouse trying to click 'save', 'ok', 'next' etc, because those options are usually automatically pre-highlighted.

### Clipboard History

Follow these steps to turn the “Clipboard History” feature on:

1. Press the windows key
2. Type "clipboard"
3. Select "Clipboard Settings"
4. Enable Clipboard History

Access previously copied items with Windows + V instead of Ctrl + V
