# Optimize Organization

## 1. Mini Garbage Cans

In every space of your house that generates trash/waste, put a small tupperware and designate it as a mini garbage can. For example, at my desk, I have a small garbage can. Wherever I have 3D printers, I have a small garbage can next to them for the small scraps that are generated. 

## 2. Distributed Hydration Stations

Similar to the mini garbage cans, have a bottle of water at every space in your house where you commonly need to drink. I have water at my desk, my bedside table, my drum kit, and my reading chair.
