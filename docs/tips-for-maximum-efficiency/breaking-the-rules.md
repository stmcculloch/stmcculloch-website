title: 'Breaking the Rules'
---

You can only get so far if you obediently follow every single rule and guideline. To be a true master of anything, you must know when to strategically go against common thinking for an unepected advantage.

Consider the game of chess. When learning, we are told to:

- Develop your pieces
- Control the center
- Castle your king
- Connect your rooks
- Don't hang pieces

Simple, right? And it's for good reason. Beginners **should** follow this advice, because most beginner games are won or lost simply because someone forgets their piece is under attack. Once you've mastered the basics though, there is room to improve by breaking these principles.
  
With enough experience, you'll know when to strategically ignore these principles to gain an advantage. If you rigidly follow every opening principle, every single game, without being flexible, you will miss many opportunities.

## Multitasking

You should never multitask, except when it makes sense to do so. You can get 2 things for the price of 1. Here are ways in which multitasking can give you benefits for free.

### Free Exercise

- Bike to work. You get exercise for free during your commute which you have to do anyway. Since you don't need to do cardio in your free time anymore, you can save over 2 hours per week. (you should be doing 2 hours of cardio per week!)
- Do the elliptical under your desk thing. Get free low intensity cardio during online meetings.

## Free Learning

- Listen to podcasts / audiobooks while doing mindless activities: 
  - Driving
  - Low to moderate workouts (For the hard workouts, blast hype music for additional strength. You shouldn't get distracted by following a conversation)
  - Cleaning the house
