# Atomic Habits

Note: This entire summary was blatanltly copied from: https://www.samuelthomasdavies.com/book-summaries/self-help/atomic-habits/
and: https://www.grahammann.net/book-notes/atomic-habits-james-clear

## Chapter 1 - The Surprising Power of Atomic Habits
- You should be far more concerned with your current **trajectory** than with your current results.
- Your outcomes are a lagging measure of your habits.
- Breakthrough moments are often the result of many previous actions, which build up the potential required to unleash a major change.
- If you’re having trouble changing your habits, the problem isn’t you. The problem is your system.
- You do not rise to the level of your goals. **You fall to the level of your systems.**
- If you want better results, then forget about setting goals. **Focus on your system instead.**


## Chapter 2 - How Your Habits Shape Your Identity (and Vice Versa)
- **True behaviour change is identity change.**
- The goal is not to read a book, the goal is to become a reader.
- Your identity emerges out of your habits.
- Each time you read a page, you are a reader.
- Every action is a vote for the type of person you wish to become.

:::info Info

In the book, a good example was someone in the process of quitting smoking. When offered a cigarette, there are two responses:

1. "No thanks, I'm trying to quit."
2. "No thanks, I'm not a smoker."

Obviously, the second one is better because it reinforces a change in their identity.

## Chapter 3 - How to Build Better Habits in 4 Simple Steps
- Habits do not restrict freedom. They create it.
- - They allow you to naturally automate things that are important
- The process of building a habit can be divided into four simple steps: cue, craving, response, and reward.
- **How to Create a Good Habit**
- The 1st law (Cue): Make it obvious.
- The 2nd law (Craving): Make it attractive.
- The 3rd law (Response): Make it easy.
- The 4th law (Reward): Make it satisfying.
- We can invert these laws to learn how to break a bad habit.
- **How to Break a Bad Habit**
- Inversion of the 1st law (Cue): Make it invisible.
- Inversion of the 2nd law (Craving): Make it unattractive.
- Inversion of the 3rd law (Response): Make it difficult.
- Inversion of the 4th law (Reward): Make it unsatisfying.

## Chapter 4 - The Man Who Didn’t Look Right
- “If you’re having trouble determining how to rate a particular habit, ask yourself: ‘Does this behavior help me become the type of person I wish to be? Does this habit cast a vote for or against my desired identity?’”    
- “Once our habits become automatic, we stop paying attention to what we are doing.”
- “The process of behavior change always starts with awareness. You need to be aware of your habits before you can change them.”
- “Pointing-and-Calling raises your level of awareness from a nonconscious habit to a more conscious level by verbalizing your actions.”
- “The Habits Scorecard is a simple exercise you can use to become more aware of your behavior.”                

## Chapter 5 - The Best Way to Start a New Habit
- Broadly speaking, the format for creating an implementation intention is:
- When situation X arises, I will perform response Y.
- Many people think they lack motivation when what they really lack is clarity.
- The habit stacking formula is:
- After [CURRENT HABIT], I will [NEW HABIT].

### My implementation intentions

Meta: 
- **I create good habits:** "When I come across a potential new good habit, I implement it for 3 weeks to see if it benefits me."
- **I stick to good habits even when it is tough:** "When a habit is tough to perform, I do a mini version of that habit to keep the routine."
- **I enjoy the process of consistent improvement.** "Before I put my phone away for the night, I track my habits using the 'Habits' app."

Health: 
- **I exercise regularly:** "When I finish playing drums, I begin my workout, unless it is a rest day"
- **I eat healthy food:** "When I go grocery shopping, 80% of the items I buy must be unprocessed, whole foods."
- **I have a consistent sleep schedule:** "At 11PM, I lie down in bed to go to sleep." "At 7 AM, I get out of bed."
- **I meditate every day:** "After I wake up, I will sit in my living room and meditate for 10-15 minutes." 
- **I don't waste time on social media:** "When I 

Finance:

- **I am a guitar player:** "When I have spare time on Friday nights, I will practice guitar for at least 30 minutes."
- **I read books and listen to educational podcasts:** "When I'm cooking, cleaning, driving, or walking, I will listen to educational books and podcasts."
- **I work on projects that are important to me:** "Every day after breakfast, I will have a focused work session before going to my job."
- **I take notes when I learn something useful:** "When I finish an educational book, I will take a summary and write down important lessons I learn in this documentation site."

Social:
- I have gratitude for my friends and family
- I have meaningful conversations with friends and family


## Chapter 6 - Motivation is Overrated; Environment Often Matters More
- Design your environment to motivate you to accomplish the things you want to.  Visual stimuli help.
- New environments can help eliminate old bad habits, and establish new ones.

### Environmental changes I have made so far: 

- Increase height of my computer monitors. Eyes straight, or slightly upward helps improve focus and alertness (and is good for ergonomics.) Thanks to Andrew Huberman
- Added light around my computer monitors to wake me up better and improve focus.
- Remove clutter in my house. Selling items that are no longer useful. Moving lesser-used items into long-term storage (caching. See [Chapter 4 in Algorithms to Live By](./algorithms-to-live-by#4-caching)
- Buy healthy food and keep them in convenient locations.
- Keep unhealthy food in inconvenient locations. 
- Put the alcohol in a cupboard.
- Keep my drums clean and accessible.

## Chapter 7 - The Secret to Self-Control
- Avoid temptations that trigger bad habits.  This is the only way to break bad habits.

## Chapter 8 - How to Make a Habit Irresistible
- The habit stacking + temptation bundling formula is:
- After [CURRENT HABIT], I will [HABIT I NEED].
- After [HABIT I NEED], I will [HABIT I WANT].

## Chapter 9 - The Role of Family & Friends in Shaping Your Habits
- We tend to imitate the habits of three social groups: the close (family and friends), the many (the tribe), and the powerful (those with status and prestige).
- One of the most effective things you can do to build better habits is to join a culture where (1) your desired behavior is the normal behavior and (2) you already have something in common with the group.

## Chapter 10 - How to Find and Fix the Causes of Your Bad Habits
- Change the language and frame of habits to make them positive.
- Ex. I “get” to exercise today, instead of I “have” to exercise today.

## Chapter 11 - Walk Slowly, but Never Backward
- Habits form based on frequency, not time.
- The most effective form of learning is practice, not planning.
- Aim for action (ex: working out), not motion (ex: reading a book on exercise plans).

## Chapter 12 - The Law of Least Effort
- Create an environment where doing the right thing is as easy as possible.
- Conversely, use environment design to make the wrong thing as difficult as possible.

## Chapter 13 - How to Stop Procrastinating by Using the Two-Minute Rule
- When you start a new habit, it should take less than two minutes to do.
- Ex: “Read before bed each night” becomes “read one page."
- Master the art of showing up, then refine.

## Chapter 14 - How to Make Good Habits Inevitable and Bad Habits Impossible
- The best way to break a bad habit is to make it impractical to do. Increase the friction until you don’t even have the option to act.
- Automate as much of your life as possible.
- Use commitment devices - a choice you make in the present that locks in future behaviour - to guarantee future actions.

## Chapter 15 - The Cardinal Rule of Behaviour Change
- What is rewarded is repeated.  What is punished is avoided.
- Add a small, immediate reward to good behaviours.
- Ex: whenever you pass on a purchase, move that amount of money to a savings account for a future purchase.

## Chapter 16 - How to Stick with Good Habits Every Day
- Track your behaviour, ideally with something visual like a calendar.
- Automate this tracking when possible.
- The habit stacking + habit tracking formula is:
- After [CURRENT HABIT], I will [TRACK MY HABIT].
- Whenever you miss a habit, don’t panic, just: never miss twice.

## Chapter 17 - How an Accountability Partner Can Change Everything
- Create a habit contract with a painful penalty with one or two other people.
- The social cost (+ whatever penalty) will make violation painful.

## Chapter 18 - The Truth About Talent
- Align your habits with your natural inclinations and abilities.
- Experiment with many things at first, and then when you find something you’re good at, exploit it and test variations occasionally.
- To maximize success, choose the right field of competition.
- Combine abilities to create a narrow field in which you can dominate.

## Chapter 19 - The Goldilocks Rule: How to Stay Motivated in Life and Work
- Humans experience peak motivation when working on tasks right on the edge of their current abilities (roughly 4% beyond your current capabilities).
- Aim for a flow state - the experience of being in the zone and fully immersed in an activity.
 
## Chapter 20 - The Downside of Creating Good Habits
- Once a skill is mastered, there can be a decline in performance over time.
- Habits + Deliberate Practice = Mastery
- Establish a system of reflection and review to avoid complacency.
- Make sure to keep your identity flexible.
- “Keep your identity small” - Paul Graham

## Conclusion: The Secret to Results That Last
- Success is not a goal to reach or a finish line to cross. It is a system to improve, an endless process to refine.
- The secret to getting results that last is to never stop making improvements.
- It’s remarkable what you can build if you just don’t stop.
- Small habits don’t add up. They compound.
